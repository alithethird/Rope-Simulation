# Rope-Simulation
The simulation of rope consisted of a bunch of masses and springs using C#. I use openGL for 3D graphics. 

**It is worth to mention that I borrowed the theme and some methods of the simulation form another project a very long time ago. Unfortunately, I do not remember the address of the corresponding website.**
